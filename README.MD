# GraphQL + H2 + Spring-boot Application

This Standalone Spring boot project demonstrates the crud operations on Tour services using H2 Database and GraphQL as
API.

## Requirements

or building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 21](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3.9.x](https://maven.apache.org) or later

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method
in the `de.codecentric.springbootsample.Application` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use
the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html)
like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once the application is running, you can access Graphiql under http://localhost:8080/graphiql
